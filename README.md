# Follow these instructions:

## Modify the `WeatherTracker.java` file to:

-  Ask the user to input the number of days for which they want to track the temperature (minimum 3, maximum 7).
   -  Ensure the inputted number of days will be within your specified range.
-  Prompt the user to enter the daily temperatures in Celsius for the specified number of days.
   -  Validate the input for each price whiles ensuring that each temperature inputted is a number between -50 and 50.
-  Store the temperatures into an array, calculate and print:
   -  The average temperature.
   -  The highest and lowest temperatures.
   -  The number of days with temperatures below 0 (cold days).
-  Print a summary for each day, stating whether the temperature was "Cold" (below 0), "Warm" (0 to 20), or "Hot" (above 20).

## Your program output should look like this:

Day 1: Temperature = 15 (Warm)  
Day 2: Temperature = -5 (Cold)  
Day 3: Temperature = 25 (Hot)  
...  
...  
...  
Average Temperature = 12.3  
Highest Temperature = 25  
Lowest Temperature = -5  
Cold Days = 1
